# INSTALLATION
Faiss works best with conda installation with all the dependencies resolved.
## First create a Environment :
```bash
conda create -n faiss-learn

# Activate the Environmet

conda activate faiss-learn
```
Install the packages
```
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu
conda install pandas numpy sentence-transformers
```

This is the Doc from where I started learning about faiss..I think it would be better to take a look at this whenever I need to reminded of how faiss works internally.
